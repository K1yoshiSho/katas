# ExpenseReport
[License: CC-BY-SA]
The ExpenseReport legacy code refactoring kata in various languages.

This is an example of a piece of legacy code with lots of code smells.
The goal is to support the following new feature as best as you can:
* Add Lunch with an expense limit of 2000.

## Process
1. 📚 Read the code to understand what it does and how it works.
2. 🦨 Read the code and check for design and code smells. Make a list of all code and design smells that you find.
3. 🧑‍🔬 Analyze what you would have to change to implement the new requirement without refactoring the code.
4. 🧪 Write a characterization test. Expand your list of code and design smells. Add those smells that you missed earlier and discovered now because they made your life writing a test miserable.
5. 🔧 Refactor the code.
6. 🔧 Refactor the test.
7. 👼 Test-drive the new feature.

## Credits and License
I first encountered the ExpenseReport example during a bootcamp at Equal Experts.
I also have seen the ExpenseReport example being used by Robert "Uncle Bob" C. Martin.
However, he seems to not be the original author (https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1537063143326855176?s=20&t=lh_vVb9jUQmY6PYG50974w)
I have tried to research its origins but so far I have failed.
If you know who has first come up with this example, please get in touch with me.

As I was asked for the license conditions, I have decided to put this under CC-BY-SA, with the following considerations:
- Please credit me, last but not least to retain the opportunity for people to experience this exercise in as many programming languages as they are interested in.
- Share it under the same license.
- Using this as training material should be allowed, even if the trainer is charging money for their time.

Disclaimer: As stated above, I did not come up with the original version.
The original author is unknown to me.
The CC-BY-SA license thus can only cover my contribution: Recreating the Java version from memory, creating the versions in other programming languages than Java, and keeping them consistent.
